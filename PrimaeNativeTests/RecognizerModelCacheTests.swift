// Contention coverage for `CoreMLLetterRecognizer`'s shared model cache.
//
// Audit finding 20's precondition. Every existing recognizer test
// injects a stub classifier (`CoreMLLetterRecognizerTests` says so in
// its own header), so `loadModelIfNeeded` — the lock, the two shared
// statics, and the lazy VNCoreMLModel load behind them — was exercised
// by ZERO tests. Swapping the lock primitive under code nothing runs is
// not a refactor, it is a guess.
//
// `isModelAvailable()` is the only reachable entry to that path: it
// calls `Self.loadModelIfNeeded()` inside a detached Task. The private
// statics stay private — this asserts observable behaviour rather than
// reaching for a test-only seam into a concurrency primitive.
//
// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SEE.
//   - Deadlock: caught, via the harness time limit. Every call takes the
//     lock, warm or cold, so contention is real regardless of ordering.
//   - Torn read of the two statics: caught, as disagreement between
//     concurrent probes.
//   - Double LOAD on a cold cache: NOT caught. The cache is process-wide
//     and another suite may have warmed it first, and the statics are
//     private so a test cannot reset them. A double load costs ~50 ms
//     and a discarded handle; it is not a correctness fault, which is
//     why it is not worth widening access to chase.
//
// The probes ALSO assert that the answer is `true` (2026-09-04). They
// used to assert agreement only, and agreement holds just as well when
// nothing loads — CI run 1633's iPad (A16) leg proved it: the suite
// timed out at 60 s in the first process, then PASSED in 0.001 s on
// xcodebuild's automatic retry, an outcome only possible if the retry's
// probes agreed on "not available". A bundle-claiming suite that passes
// when the bundle does not resolve asserts nothing; the availability
// assertion turns that vacuous pass into the failure it is.
//
// TIMING, MEASURED from the same run (job logs, 2026-09-04): the first
// `isModelAvailable()` in a fresh simulator process took ~32 s on the
// iPad Pro (M5) leg and > 60 s on the iPad (A16) leg, and because
// `loadModelIfNeeded` holds a blocking lock while loading, every probe
// parked on it occupied a cooperative-pool thread — unrelated tests in
// the same process reported "passed after 59.6 seconds". Hence three
// probes, not eight, and a limit above the measured floor: the limit
// still turns a real deadlock into a named failure; it no longer turns
// a slow simulator into one.
//
// HISTORICAL NOTE, because this suite's name promised more than its
// first run delivered: when written, the model did not resolve at all,
// so the probes agreed on `nil`. That is a weaker statement than
// agreeing on one shared instance, and the double-load race the suite
// was written for cannot occur when nothing loads.
