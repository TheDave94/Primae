// Resource-resolution regression net.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The CoreML model resolved through a path nobody
// had verified and was dark for three months — `recognition_predicted`
// empty in 194 of 194 recognition-bearing records across 41 sessions —
// because a missing model is DESIGNED to degrade quietly. `cb7291d`
// fixed that one resource and pinned it with `BundleResolutionTests`.
//
// Every other bundled resource had the same shape and none of the same
// coverage. Each of these fails silently by design:
//
//   spatial_carrier.wav  the spatial arm plays nothing, which is
//                        behaviourally IDENTICAL to the silent control
//                        arm — a corrupted independent variable that
//                        looks like a valid one
//   fonts                `urls.isEmpty` logs a warning and returns; the
//                        app renders in the system face
//   effect sounds        `systemFallback` chimes, or for tick_stroke
//                        (fallback nil) plays nothing at all
//   letter audio         "no audio files found" is an issue entry, not
//                        a failure
//
// The pre-existing arm-routing tests could not see any of this:
//
//   #expect(vm.activeAudioFiles(for: asset()) == [SpatialSonification.carrierToneFile])
//
// asserts a String constant against itself and never touches the disk.
// Delete the carrier and every one of those tests still passes.
//
// WHAT "RESOLVES" MEANS HERE. Each assertion goes through `PrimaeBundle`,
// the resolver the app itself uses, and — except where noted — through
// the PACKAGE bundle specifically rather than `PrimaeBundle`'s `.main`
// last resort. The package bundle is the one that exists in both layouts:
// nested in `PrimaeNative.framework` in the app, and nested in the same
// framework inside `PrimaeNativeTests.xctest` under test. Proving a
// resource resolves there is what makes app and test agree; a test that
// accepted the `.main` fallback would pass on a host that embeds a copy
// while the package bundle shipped without it.
