// Coordinator-level coverage for which measurement fields land on which

//
// Audit finding 19: `PhaseTransitionCoordinator.recordSessionCompletion`
// discards the `LearningPhase` type into `[String: Double]` and then
// re-derives it with eight `phase == "freeWrite"` string comparisons to
// decide which of six fields to attach. Nothing tested that decision.
// `MeasurementLayerTests` builds a `PhaseSessionRecord` directly and
// tests the *exporter*; every other `recordPhaseSession` reference in
// the suite is a direct store call or a no-op stub. So a coordinator
// that attached `frechetDistance` to the guided row — or dropped it
// from the freeWrite row — shipped green.
//
// This suite drives the real path from the VM's public entry:
//   advanceLearningPhase() → advance() → assess → runRecognizerForFreeWrite
//     → completePostFreeWriteRecognition → celebrateFreeWrite
//     → recordSessionCompletion → recordPhaseSession × phases
// and captures every argument of every `recordPhaseSession` call.
