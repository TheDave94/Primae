// Golden coverage for the CSV export's arm-stratified metric section.
//
// Audit finding 22: `letterByArm`, `letterByAudioArm`,
// `averageFreeWriteScore_*`, `schedulerEffectivenessProxy_*` and
// `phaseCompletionRate_*` had ZERO test coverage — a refactor could
// drop a whole row family and CI would stay green. The pre-existing
// `ParentDashboardExporterTests` are `csv.contains(…)` spot-checks,
// which is precisely how the gap survived: a substring probe passes
// as long as *something* resembling the row appears anywhere.
//
// This suite parses the metric section into structured rows and
// asserts arity, domain, and the exact expected row set. A dropped
// family, a renamed column, a lost field, or a mis-keyed grouping all
// fail here.
//
// FIXTURE DESIGN — the thesis axis and the audio axis are deliberately
// DECORRELATED. Letter A's three completed freeWrite records sit in one
// thesis arm (`threePhase`) but split across two audio arms (2 phoneme,
// 1 spatial). If a refactor collapsed the twin blocks onto a single key
// path, `letterByAudioArm` would report A once with n=3 instead of
// twice with n=2 and n=1, and `armsAreKeyedIndependently` fails.
