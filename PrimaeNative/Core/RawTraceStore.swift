// RawTraceStore.swift
// PrimaeNative
//
// Per-trial raw freeWrite traces — points + timestamps + forces + stroke
// breaks — captured at phase exit BEFORE the buffer clears on the next
// letter load. Re-analysis insurance against the unvalidated
// Schreibmotorik scorer (C1): any future metric can be recomputed from
// the raw trace, which is otherwise discarded forever.
//
// Deliberately a SEPARATE store from ParentDashboardStore: that snapshot
// is re-encoded on the main actor on every persist and is designed to
// stay <100 KB. Raw traces are large, cold, export-only data that must
// not bloat that hot path. Records link to their trace by
// `PhaseSessionRecord.rawTraceID`.
