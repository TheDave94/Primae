//
// Pre-task sound-arm demonstration, per the 2026-09-03 study-design
// instruction: both sound arms get a brief demonstration BEFORE the
// tracing task, structurally matched in duration and form, and neither
// coupled to the child's own trace.
//
// THE REASON FOR THE SYMMETRY: a demonstration can INSTALL a crossmodal
// mapping rather than reveal one already there. If only one arm got a
// pre-task demonstration, that arm's later tracing-task audio wouldn't
// just be "the arm's sound" — it would be "the arm's sound, already
// taught". That confounds the arm contrast with having been taught,
// not with what the sound itself is. So every arm gets a demonstration
// of the SAME shape; only its sound differs (or is absent) — the same
// "only audio varies" shape as pilot decision D1.
//
// Content per arm:
//   .phoneme  — a sound-letter exposure: the letter's own phoneme,
//               played once.
//   .spatial  — an axis demonstration: a scripted pitch/pan sweep
//               across the FULL canvas range, independent of any
//               specific letter's shape (a letter with a short stroke
//               would otherwise give a foreshortened, letter-dependent
//               sweep — see `axisSweep`).
//   .silent   — no audio is added. The unchanged ghost-letter animation
//               (LetterAnimationGuide / AnimationGuideController) that
//               already precedes tracing in every arm today IS the
//               silent arm's matched non-auditory equivalent: every
//               arm already gets the SAME visual demonstration of the
//               SAME duration; sound arms layer their own scripted
//               sound onto that same window, silent doesn't.
//
// NOT trace-coupled: `TracingViewModel.armPreTaskDemonstration` drives
// this from its OWN scripted timeline (`axisSweep`, or a single
// phoneme play), never from `TouchDispatcher`'s live-touch coupling —
// a structurally distinct mechanism from the tracing-task coupling
// §2.6 governs.
