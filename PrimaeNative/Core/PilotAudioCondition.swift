// PilotAudioCondition.swift
// PrimaeNative
//
// Audio-arm infrastructure for the three-arm pilot study.
//
// Orthogonal to `ThesisCondition` (the pedagogical-flow axis): this enum
// is the AUDIO axis. Per pilot decision D1 the pedagogical flow is held
// constant and only the audio varies across arms (phoneme /
// spatial-sonification / silent). It is modelled as a SEPARATE axis so a
// future crossed (pedagogical × audio) design isn't precluded.
//
// H1 scope: assignment + persistence + export only. Per-arm playback
// routing — `activeAudioFiles(for:)` branching and the silent
// short-circuit — is H2 and is deliberately NOT wired here.
