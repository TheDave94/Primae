/// The study session's voiceover (P3, David 2026-10-04): the SPOKEN
/// content is IDENTICAL in all three arms.
///
/// Speech used to be switched off together with the silent arm's sound
/// (ruling C3-2's null pair), so with spoken feedback on, the phoneme and
/// spatial arms heard the phase prompts and the silent arm heard none — a
/// second difference between arms that the design does not contain.
/// Speech is not sonification: the silent arm's condition is that WRITING
/// makes no sound, and that stays unconditional (`SilentAudio`,
/// `TouchDispatcher`'s silent-arm return).
///
/// What passes, by construction rather than by call-site discipline:
///   - `play(key:)` for the phrases in `studySpokenKeys` — the phase-entry
///     prompts and the end-of-set phrase — in every arm alike. The
///     score-dependent praise tiers, paper-transfer and retrieval phrases
///     are not in the set, so no arm hears them in a study session (the
///     praise tiers were unreachable there before this, too).
///   - The non-speech effects (stroke tick, success chime, tap chimes) are
///     sound, so they follow the arm: forwarded while
///     `soundEffectsAllowed` (the phoneme and spatial arms), dropped for
///     the silent arm. `applyArmAuthority` updates it when the arm changes
///     mid-session.
///
/// Speech that goes through `vm.speech` directly ("Probier's nochmal")
/// is not filtered here; it reaches every arm through the same real
/// synthesiser, because a study voiceover session no longer nulls it for
/// the silent arm.
