// THE PRIMARY accuracy outcome AND the process-level secondaries
// (stroke count, order, direction), from ONE computation (2026-09-04,
// superseding the 2026-09-03 Hausdorff-over-the-whole-trace design).
//
// WHY NOT SHAPE NORMALISATION (Procrustes rejected): scale and rotation
// are already controlled by this task's design — a fixed reference and
// a defined canvas — so normalising them buys nothing, and rotation-
// invariance is actively wrong: a letter drawn upside down is an
// error, not a nuisance parameter to fit away. The defect the
// 2026-09-03 redesign was chasing was never a shape-normalisation
// problem. Hausdorff over the whole trace was order-invariant at the
// POINT-CLOUD level, but it still let a spatially perfect letter with
// strokes in an unusual order score as well as the canonical order —
// no, wait, that's what it FIXED — the residual problem was subtler:
// neither Hausdorff-over-the-cloud nor Fréchet-over-the-concatenated-
// path ever asked "which of MY strokes corresponds to which of THE
// REFERENCE'S strokes" — one discarded stroke identity entirely, the
// other assumed trace-order == reference-order. Both are shape
// analyses; the actual invariance this study needs is stroke
// CORRESPONDENCE.
//
// THE APPROACH: match each traced stroke to its best-fitting reference
// stroke — order-invariant, because the matching decides pairing, not
// arrival order — then measure deviation WITHIN each matched pair.
// Fréchet distance (Eiter & Mannila 1994) is exactly right for that
// within-pair measurement (it stays a sequence-sensitive, single-curve
// distance); what changes is that it is never applied to a
// concatenation of strokes the reference and the child may have
// visited in different orders. The mean of the matched pairs' own
// Fréchet distances IS the order-invariant PRIMARY outcome
// (`spatialDeviation`). The recovered pairing IS the process
// secondaries: `matchedReferenceOrder` is the stroke-order measurement,
// and a stroke-COUNT mismatch (more or fewer traced strokes than the
// reference has) is the stroke-count measurement — nothing bolted on
// separately.
//
// DIRECTION REVERSAL is handled IN the pairing, not normalised away:
// for each candidate (traced stroke, reference stroke) pair, BOTH
// traversal directions are tried and the cheaper one wins — a reversed
// stroke is a process finding worth recording (`reversedStrokeCount`),
// not noise to erase from the distance.
//
// LITERATURE GROUNDING (searched 2026-09-04, per instruction: search
// handwriting-recognition / letter-formation-scoring, not morphometrics
// — Procrustes belongs to the latter and doesn't treat this problem):
// "stroke correspondence search" is the established term for exactly
// this — matching a stroke-order-free / stroke-number-free input
// against a reference character. Five representative correspondence-
// search methods are surveyed in the online-handwriting-recognition
// literature (cube search, bipartite weighted matching, individual
// correspondence decision, stable marriage, deviation-expansion) —
// Kaneko & Chen et al.'s stroke-order-free/stroke-number-free method
// (USPTO 5,796,867) and the comparative survey "Comparative performance
// analysis of stroke correspondence search methods for stroke-order
// free online multi-stroke character recognition" (Front. Comput. Sci.,
// Springer) name this exact problem. Bipartite weighted matching is the
// Hungarian (Kuhn–Munkres) assignment algorithm; unequal stroke counts
// are the linear sum assignment problem with error-correction (LSAPE)
// — insertions/deletions carry an explicit cost against a "do not
// match" option.
//
// SIMPLIFIED DELIBERATELY from that general framework, for this
// domain: bundled Latin letters have at most a handful of strokes, so
// (a) EXHAUSTIVE search over the small assignment space replaces the
// Hungarian algorithm — same optimum, no new dependency, and this runs
// once per phase completion, never per frame; (b) rather than LSAPE's
// tunable null-match cost (which would need calibration evidence this
// domain doesn't have), matching is FORCED to maximum cardinality —
// exactly `min(tracedCount, referenceCount)` pairs, always the
// cheapest such assignment. A traced stroke's "extra" or "missing"
// status therefore falls out of the COUNT difference alone (already
// exactly what `strokeCount` reports against the reference's own
// per-letter stroke count), not from a per-pair cost threshold this
// domain has no evidence to set correctly.
//
// Derived entirely from data already persisted (RawTrace's points +
// strokeStartIndices), so prior sessions remain re-derivable.
