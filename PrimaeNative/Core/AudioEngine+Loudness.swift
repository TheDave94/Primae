// Per-file loudness normalisation, kept OUT of AudioEngine.swift for the
// same reason as AudioEngine+SpatialPitch (LESSONS.md: that file must
// not grow surface area). Ruling AE-2 (2026-09-06): a per-letter
// loudness difference between phoneme recordings is a systematic
// within-arm confound — some letters would simply be louder than others
// for reasons unrelated to the study, along the very vowel/continuant
// line the letter set spans. So every file the engine loads is played at
// a gain that brings its RMS to ONE target, whatever level it was
// recorded or rendered at.
//
// RMS, not peak (AE-2a): peak equalises the loudest sample, and
// fricatives and vowels have very different crest factors — peak would
// leave most of the vowel/consonant bias in place. And RMS over the
// STEADY STATE, not the whole file: see `fileRMS`.
//
// The target is the bundled spatial carrier's own RMS (measured
// 2026-09-06: 16-bit PCM, peak 8231 = −12.0 dBFS, rms/peak 0.5825 →
// 0.1463 full-scale; constant, so steady state = whole file). The verified carrier therefore plays at unity gain
// — nothing about the spatial arm's stimulus changes — and the phoneme
// arm's files are matched to it, which also removes the between-arm
// level difference the thesis records as a limitation.
