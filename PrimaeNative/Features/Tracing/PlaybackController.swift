// PlaybackController.swift

//
// Audio-playback state machine, debounced transitions, and play-intent
// wall-time deduplication for rapid tap bursts.
//
// FRAGILE — see docs/LESSONS.md before touching audio:
//   - MainActor-bound; no audio command moves off the main thread.
//   - `request(_:immediate:)` with immediate=true is fully synchronous;
//     the VM's load(letter:) path depends on this sync contract.
//   - Debounce timings are asserted against in TracingViewModelTests.
