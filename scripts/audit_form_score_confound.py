"""Audit an EXISTING progress.json for the 2026-09-04 fix: the CoreML
confidence calibrator's practised-letter boost ("historicalFormScores")
was fed `recognitionAccuracy` — the recognizer's own past CONFIDENCE —
where the code documents needing historical geometric FORM accuracy
(`WritingAssessment.formAccuracy`). No channel carrying real form-
accuracy history existed before the fix (`formAccuracyHistory`, added
alongside it), so every boost decision made before the fix used the
wrong instrument.

This machine (a sandboxed advisor seat) has no real device/simulator
progress.json to inspect — this script exists so a real one CAN be
audited, e.g. one pulled from a physical iPad or a TestFlight/pilot
device's Application Support directory
(`.../Application Support/PrimaeNative/progress.json`).

What it reports, per letter with recognitionAccuracy history:
  - the recognitionAccuracy (confidence) samples on record
  - whether the OLD buggy boost condition would have fired:
    >= minimumHistorySamples (5) samples, mean >= historyStrongThreshold
    (0.80) — the exact ConfidenceCalibrator thresholds, duplicated here
    deliberately rather than imported, since this script has no Swift
    runtime to call into
  - formAccuracyHistory, if present (only exists on installs that ran
    at least one freeWrite completion AFTER the fix landed)

A letter flagged "BOOST WOULD HAVE FIRED" had its recognition confidence
(and therefore PhaseSessionRecord.recognitionConfidence /
recognitionConfidenceRaw for any session recorded after that point)
inflated by up to 10% (the configured `historyBoost`), based on the
recognizer's own past confidence rather than the child's actual
handwriting quality.
