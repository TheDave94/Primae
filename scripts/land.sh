#!/bin/sh
# land.sh — one command per change: commit, push, PR, squash-merge, report.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Landing a change used to be three commands handed over
# one at a time, and each hand-off had its own way of going wrong: a branch
# name invented at the prompt that did not match the one checked out, a
# commit message written to a path that did not exist, and commit / push /
# gitflow drifting apart because three commands are three chances to be
# wrong instead of one. This collapses them into a single call whose only
# manual acts are the two that can ONLY be manual — the YubiKey tap on the
# commit, and reading the verification output afterwards.
#
# USAGE
#   sh scripts/land.sh <<'MSG'
#   type(scope): subject line, which becomes the PR title
#
#   Body. This becomes the PR body: gitflow carries HEAD's commit body into
#   the PR, so anything below the subject travels with the merge.
#   MSG
#
# The message arrives on STDIN and nowhere else. There is no --file flag and
# no default path, so "the commit message file does not exist" is not a
# failure this script is capable of having.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not run the tests. Verification
# is the other thing that stays yours — a script that both lands a change and
# grades it is a script that can report a green it never earned.
#
# FAILURE DISCIPLINE. Every step is checked explicitly and stops the run at
# the first error. No `&&` chains, which fall through to the next command
# when an earlier one fails, and no pipes on any step whose exit status
# matters — in `a | b` the status is b's, so a piped `git commit` reports the
# health of `tee`, not of the commit.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   2  precondition refused (on main, empty message, nothing to commit, …)
#   3  environment missing (not a git checkout, gitflow.sh absent)
#   1  a step failed (commit, push, gitflow, fetch)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- self-test
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every refusal below was driven by hand once, from outside
# the script, and that proof expired the moment the file was next edited. A
# guard that is written but never dispatched to is indistinguishable, to a
# reviewer reading the source, from a guard that works: writing the branch
# and writing the dispatch are two acts and only one of them is visible.
# This repo has now shipped three of those (an empty SURFACES, a `>= 0`
# assertion that held in both directions, and typecheck_package.sh's own
# --self-test silently swallowed by an argument parser).
#
# So the drives live in the script, and CASE 11 is the one that would have
# caught all three: it proves --self-test is REACHABLE, by re-entering this
# branch in a child process and requiring the token back. If --self-test is
# ever moved below the catch-all, the child answers with the unknown-argument
# FATAL instead and this fails.
