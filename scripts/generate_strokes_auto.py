"""Anchor-spec stroke generator for Primae.

Architecture (four stages, applied to closed-bowl walker letters):
  1. Walker primitive (walk/continuous/loop) produces a candidate
     polyline by BFS-walking the letter's skimage skeleton between
     cardinal anchors. Extracted from commit 77f1c220.
  2. Per-stroke mask isolation builds a boolean mask containing only
     that stroke's ink (thick-line band for STRAIGHT walks; full-mask-
     minus-straight-masks with shared-anchor row-split for CURVED).
  3. Medial-axis snap pulls every polyline checkpoint to the local
     distance-transform maximum of its stroke's isolated mask.
  4. Static-artifact escape hatch for letters where stages 1-3 don't
     produce a clean polyline. The iPad debug calibrator
     (PrimaeNative/Features/Tracing/StrokeCalibrationOverlay.swift)
     lets a human drag-edit checkpoint positions on the rendered
     glyph and export the result as JSON. The exported strokes.json
     is committed verbatim; the letter is added to
     SHIPPED_AS_STATIC_ARTIFACT and the bake pipeline skips it.

Non-walker letters (M, V, W, A, etc.) use the existing line-kind
primitive architecture (straight_line + fillets/sharp joints). They
shipped clean from an earlier pipeline and are byte-identical
across pipeline changes.

See `docs/BAKE_INVARIANTS.md` for the permanent centerline rules — every
bake must satisfy centerline location, centerline shape, stroke type
purity, and junction continuity. Apply to every letter, every weight.

Each letter is authored as a list of `StrokeSpec` dicts where each spec
holds a sequence of pedagogical anchor names. At bake time, anchors
resolve to font-specific pixel positions on the rasterised glyph and a
Dijkstra-on-distance-transform walker synthesises the centerline path
between consecutive anchors. The centerline stays inside the ink and
follows the deepest column of the stroke.

Why anchor specs over hand-authored tuples: anchor names are
font-independent. Adding a second font requires no per-letter tuning —
the bake re-resolves each anchor against the new font's ink. The
medial-axis pipeline had geometry mismatches with pedagogical stroke
decomposition; the polyline-tuple pipeline solved that but required
per-font re-eyeballing. Anchor specs combine the clean pedagogical
decomposition of polylines with deterministic font portability.

The rasteriser also centers the glyph by its **optical outline bbox**
(via fonttools `BoundsPen`) rather than Pillow's layout bbox (which
includes asymmetric side bearings). This matches iPad's
`CTFontGetBoundingRectsForGlyphs` placement and prevents the
side-bearing drift that shifted glyphs 5–16 px between Python and iPad
in the polyline-era bake.

Pipeline per letter:

  1. Rasterise the glyph, centering by optical bbox so the ink mask is
     positioned where iPad will render it. Compute the path bbox.
  2. Resolve every anchor name in the spec to a (col, row) raster
     pixel. Anchor resolution rules — see `ANCHOR_RESOLVERS`.
  3. Compute the Euclidean distance transform of the ink mask once.
  4. For each consecutive anchor pair: Dijkstra shortest path with
     edge weight = step_length / (dt[pixel] + 1). Deep-ink pixels are
     cheaper, so the path tracks the medial axis.
  5. Concatenate per-segment paths into one stroke pixel chain.
  6. Resample uniformly to `CHECKPOINT_COUNT`; convert to bbox-relative.
  7. Skeleton = deduplicated union of all stroke pixels; skeletonAdj =
     8-connected adjacency on those pixels.
  8. Emit strokes.json — schema unchanged from the medial-axis era.

Anchor name vocabulary (font-independent):

  TL TR BL BR     bbox corners; step from corner toward ink centroid
                  until hitting an ink pixel.
  T B             topmost / bottommost ink pixel anywhere in the
                  glyph; ties broken by proximity to bbox x-center.
  TC BC           column-wise top / bottom extremum closest to bbox
                  x-center. Picks a local feature (M's valley, V's
                  apex, W's top peak) instead of an absolute extremum
                  that lands on a corner / serif.
  ML MR           midline left / right — ink pixel at the bbox y-center
                  row, leftmost / rightmost.
  LEFT_MID        leftmost ink pixel, vertically centered (closest y to
                  bbox y-center).
  RIGHT_MID       rightmost ink pixel, vertically centered.
  UPPER_TOUCH     upper / lower contact points where a bowl meets a
  LOWER_TOUCH     stem (b, p, d, q, etc.). Resolved by skeletonising
                  the ink, finding degree-≥3 junction clusters in the
                  left third of bbox, then sorting by y.

If an anchor doesn't resolve (e.g. `UPPER_TOUCH` on `N`), the bake
raises a `ValueError` naming the offending letter / spec / anchor.

    Motivation: when an arm's bbox-relative anchors snap onto adjacent
    strokes' skeletons (A's ML/MR snap to the diagonals, not the
    crossbar's medial ridge), the BFS path between snapped endpoints is
    L-shaped — descend a perpendicular leg, traverse the on-axis ridge,
    ascend the other leg. SVD over the full path averages the legs into
    the fit, drifting the resulting line off the true centerline.

    For paths whose every segment is already on-axis (most letters),
    the trim is benign — the longest contiguous run is the full path.

    Falls back to the input unchanged when:
    - the path is too short (<5 segments) to detect direction reliably,
    - the anchor-pair direction is degenerate (zero length),
    - or the on-axis run is shorter than 4 segments after trimming."""
