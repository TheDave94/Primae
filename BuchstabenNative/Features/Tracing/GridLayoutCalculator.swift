/// Pure layout function: given a canvas size and an `InputPreset`, return
/// per-cell frames. Extracted from `SequenceGridController` so the math is
/// unit-testable in isolation and can't accidentally touch cell state.
///
/// Migration-neutral contract: with `InputPreset.finger` (cellCount=1,
/// spacing=12, inset=0), the single returned frame equals the whole canvas.
/// The existing single-letter renderer sees no coordinate change when
/// routed through the grid engine.
///
/// **Caching.** `TracingCanvasView`'s body re-evaluates this on every
/// SwiftUI redraw triggered by the VM (≈100 Hz during a Pencil stroke
/// thanks to `pencilPressure`). The function itself is cheap, but the
/// returned `[CGRect]` allocates a fresh array on every call. A 2-entry
/// memo keyed on `(canvasSize, preset)` avoids that churn — finger and
/// pencil presets are the only two flavours in use, and the canvas
/// size only changes on rotation, so the cache hits 99 % of the time.
