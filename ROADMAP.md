## At a glance — what's next

### Your ball (asset work + device validation)

| Item | Owner action | Why it matters | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **T1** lowercase strokes for `a f i k l m o` | Author stroke definitions on iPad via the calibration overlay; record name audio (3 takes/letter); export to `Resources/Letters/<x>/` | Thesis-floor — the four-phase pedagogy currently doesn't run for lowercase, and a reviewer who picks `q` lands on the empty-strokes fallback | **14–21 hours** |
| **P6** phoneme audio recordings | Generate 90 phoneme recordings via ElevenLabs (3 takes × 30 letters) using the prompt template + IPA table in Appendix C of `docs/APP_DOCUMENTATION.md`; drop into `Resources/Letters/<base>/` as `<base>_phoneme<n>.mp3` | Phonemic awareness ↔ reading acquisition (Adams 1990); the "Lautwert wiedergeben" toggle is already shipped — without recordings it falls back silently | **XL** (recording-time-bound) |
| **U5** Pencil 2 squeeze validation | iPad with Apple Pencil 2 — confirm squeeze + double-tap fire `replayAudio()` and don't double-fire with finger taps | Code is shipped; just needs verifying the gesture lands as intended on real hardware | **0–1 days on device** |
| **U10** VoiceOver walkthrough | iPad with VoiceOver enabled — walk every screen, watch for skipped elements / misordered focus / Switch Control routing / Dynamic Type clipping | Required before submitting the thesis externally; the partial in-code audit shipped, but the device walkthrough is the load-bearing part | **2–3 hours on device** |

### Engineering ball (in-loop sessions with me)

| Item | What I need from you | Why it can't be autonomous |
|---|---|---|
| **D1b** extract `TouchDispatcher` from VM | A focused review session — one PR, ~300 lines moved, you confirm the touch-debounce + audio-gate + stroke-completion behaviour is intact between commits | `updateTouch` is the hottest code path; runtime regressions there don't surface in the existing test suite |
| **D1c** extract `PhaseTransitionCoordinator` | Similar review session, after D1b is stable for ~24 hours | Same risk profile: the post-transition side-effect block touches every store and the overlay queue |
| **U11** dark-mode parity | iPad + 1 hour of paired tonal validation | Card surfaces need re-toning from `Color.white` to `secondarySystemGroupedBackground`; failure modes are visible only on device |
| **D8** canvas redraw profile | iPad + Instruments time-profile of a high-velocity guided session | No measured evidence of a problem; pre-optimising could break a currently-correct redraw path |

Everything in the **post-thesis** section (F1–F10) waits until the thesis ships.

## What's already shipped this session (for context — not action)

This list is intentionally collapsed; the detail lives in commit messages. Removing the duplication that previously lived in `docs/ROADMAP_V5_DEFERRED_NOTES.md`.

- **Thesis data correctness:** condition-tagged samples, timezone header, wallClockSeconds, raw recognition confidence, researcher arm override, input-mode on durations, EXPORT_SCHEMA appendix.
- **Pedagogical features:** self-explanation re-animation on misrecognition, errorless first-3-sessions ramp, daily goal pill, spaced-retrieval testing prompts (P1 — `RetrievalScheduler`, `RetrievalPromptView`, opt-in toggle, motorSimilarity-cluster distractors, `retrievalAccuracy` CSV column), backward-chaining direct-phase toggle (P5), onboarding A/B variants with first-completion lock (U4), phoneme audio infrastructure (P6 — toggle + filename convention + scanner partition).
- **UX:** reward-celebration overlay, Schreibmotorik dimension sparklines, gold-tint token unification, celebration haptic, speech-rate slider, Bob-the-dog start-cue dwell.
- **Tech debt:** `SchemaMigrator` framework, `PaperTransferView` deterministic timing seam, CoreML classifier-closure protocol seam (D3) with 7 pipeline tests, `RecognitionTokenTracker` extracted (D1a — first VM-decomposition slice), CI timeout caps, accessibility partial (Schreibqualität rows collapse to single VoiceOver elements).

## 1. THESIS-CRITICAL

### T1 — Lowercase letter coverage *(asset work + on-device authoring)*
**Effort:** XL · **Priority:** P1

`Resources/Letters/` has 56 directories (26 upper + 26 lower + Ä Ö Ü ß). 25 have non-empty `strokes.json`; 31 have **empty** stroke arrays as placeholders. The empty-stroke fallback path is correct (`LearningPhaseController` skips observe + direct phases when strokes are empty), but it means the four-phase pedagogy that the thesis demonstrates **does not actually run** for 31 of 56 letters. The thesis claim "Vier-Phasen-Pädagogik for Volksschule 1. Klasse" is exposed: a reviewer who picks `q` gets the empty-strokes fallback.

**What's needed per letter.**
1. **Stroke definition.** 1–3 strokes per letter, each with 5–15 checkpoints in 0–1 cell-local coordinates. Author by:
   - Open the app in Debug mode (long-press the phase indicator on SchuleWorldView)
   - Open the calibration overlay (long-press again)
   - Drag-place each checkpoint visually over the rendered glyph
   - The calibration store writes to `Application Support/BuchstabenNative/calibration/`
   - Export the calibrated checkpoints into the bundle's `Resources/Letters/<x>/strokes.json`
2. **PBM bitmap fallback.** Optional but the validator complains without it.
3. **Audio takes.** 3 mp3 recordings of the letter name (`<x>1.mp3`, `<x>2.mp3`, `<x>3.mp3`).
4. **Phoneme audio.** P6 infrastructure is in place; you need 3 phoneme takes per letter. See Appendix C in `docs/APP_DOCUMENTATION.md` for the convention and ElevenLabs prompt template.

**Per-letter budget.** ~2–3 hours, mostly the calibration session + audio editing.

**Two viable scopes.**
- **Demo lowercase set** (`a f i k l m o`): 7 letters × 2–3 hours = 14–21 hours. **Thesis-floor minimum.**
- **Full alphabet** (26 lowercase + 19 missing uppercase + 4 umlauts/ß = 49 letters): ~100–150 hours. Post-thesis or a multi-week dedicated authoring sprint.

**What you can do without a device.** Pre-generate stroke definitions from CoreText measurements run on macOS (small `swift run` script that loads Primae, renders each glyph, samples the path). Won't be perfect (Primae's glyph metrics depend on font-loading order) but gets you 80% of the way as a starting point for device calibration. Audio generation via ElevenLabs is fully offline-able.

**Citation.** Berninger et al. 2006 (*Developmental Neuropsychology* 29(1)) — early instruction benefits from grouped upper- and lowercase exposure.

### P6 — Phoneme audio recordings *(infrastructure on main; audio assets pending)*
**Effort:** XL (recording + voice direction work) · **Priority:** P1

Phonemic awareness (Adams 1990) predicts later reading acquisition; pairing handwriting practice with the *sound* the letter makes (`/a/` as in *Affe*) instead of just its name (`/aː/`) is curriculum-aligned for German Volksschule.

**What's already in code (on `main`).**
- `LetterAsset.phonemeAudioFiles: [String]` — populated by `LetterRepository.partitionPhonemeAudio` from the bundle scan.
- `enablePhonemeMode: Bool` UserDefaults toggle, threaded through `TracingDependencies` and the VM.
- All 7 audio call sites (replay, variants, autoplay, begin-touch reload, direct-phase first-tap, load() prime) routed through `activeAudioFiles(for:)` helper. Toggle-on with no phoneme recordings → silent fallback to letter-name set.
- SettingsView "Lautwert" section with the toggle + Adams 1990 caption.

**What's still needed.**
1. **Audio recordings** following the convention `<base>_phoneme<n>.<ext>` per Appendix C in `docs/APP_DOCUMENTATION.md`. Three takes per letter (different voices for child preference). 30 letters × 3 takes = 90 recordings.
2. ElevenLabs prompt template + per-letter IPA reference table is in the appendix. Generation should be straightforward; clean-up (trim silence, normalise to -16 LUFS, export at 44.1 kHz mp3) is the per-file labour.
3. **Bundle wiring.** Drop the files into `BuchstabenNative/Resources/Letters/<base>/`. Repository scan picks them up automatically; no Swift code changes required.
4. **Verification checklist** (in the appendix): toggle on → tap → phoneme plays; two-finger swipe cycles through takes; toggle off → name resumes.

## 3. UX — DEFERRED

### U5 — Apple Pencil 2 squeeze *(wired on main; needs device validation)*
**Effort:** S (already done in code) — but **0–1 days for device validation** · **Priority:** P3

**Status.** Wired into `PencilAwareCanvasOverlay`. `UIPencilInteraction` is installed lazily; squeeze and double-tap both trigger `vm.replayAudio()`. Devices without `UIPencilInteraction` support pass nil and the interaction is never installed.

**What's needed before merging to main.** Real iPad with Apple Pencil 2nd gen, in your hand. Check:
- Squeeze fires the audio replay (not a "switch tools" default action).
- Double-tap (the legacy gesture) also fires the audio replay.
- Finger-only sessions never invoke the handler.
- Audio doesn't double-fire when squeeze + finger-tap occur in rapid succession.

If any of those fails on device, the fix is a tweak in `Coordinator.pencilInteractionDidTap`.

---

### U10 — Accessibility audit *(partial shipped; full audit needs device)*
**Effort:** S–M · **Priority:** P3

**What's already done (on `main`).**
- Schreibqualität dimension rows collapse to one VoiceOver element per row ("Form, 78 Prozent") instead of three separate focuses.
- Reward badges, daily-goal pill, settings additions, celebration overlay all carry combined-element labels + hints.
- Sparkline view is `accessibilityHidden(true)`.

**What's still needed (real iPad with VoiceOver enabled).**
- Walk every screen in VoiceOver order. Watch for skipped elements, misordered focus, ambiguous labels.
- Verify the order of focus in `SchuleWorldView` after a phase advance — does the "Weiter" button get focus before the celebration is announced, or vice versa?
- Switch Control routing — direct-phase dot taps need to be reachable via the switch.
- AssistiveTouch overlay — confirm the touch-handler hierarchy doesn't block AssistiveTouch's hit-testing.
- Dynamic Type stress test — the dashboard rows should not clip at the largest accessibility text size.

**Recommendation.** Schedule 2–3 hours with VoiceOver enabled on the iPad before submitting the thesis to anyone external.

---

### U11 — Dark-mode parity
**Effort:** M (~1 day code + ≥2 hr device validation) · **Priority:** P3

**Why deferred.** `FortschritteWorldView` and the freeform writing canvas pin `.preferredColorScheme(.light)` because their card surfaces use opaque `Color.white`. In dark mode without the pin, the cards turn near-black but the text styles (which rely on `.primary`) flip to white — the white text on white-because-pinned-light cards already works, but the card edges and shadows lose contrast.

`SchuleWorldView`, `WerkstattWorldView`, and the parent dashboards adapt fine in dark mode; only Fortschritte and Freeform are pinned.

**The change.**

```swift
// Today
.background(Color.white, in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 24))

// After
.background(
    Color(uiColor: .secondarySystemGroupedBackground),
    in: RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 24)
)
```

`secondarySystemGroupedBackground` is white in light mode, dark grey in dark mode — auto-adapts. After the swap, remove the `.preferredColorScheme(.light)` pin.

**Affected files.**
- `Features/Worlds/FortschritteWorldView.swift` — 4 cards (starCount, streak, dailyGoal, fluencyFooter) + the rewards row
- `Features/Tracing/FreeformWritingView.swift` — canvas chrome + result popups
- Possibly `Features/Tracing/CompletionCelebrationOverlay.swift` — gradient stays; white scrim opacity might need tuning

**Failure modes.** `AppSurface.starGold` pops against white but might look harsh on dark grey. Letter glyph rendered as `Color.primary` over the card → white-on-grey in dark mode (verify legibility for a 5-year-old: 7:1 body-text contrast, 3:1 large-text). Material backgrounds inside `List` already adapt; double-adapting can render weirdly.

**Recommendation.** Worth doing post-thesis. Children use the app in classroom / daylight conditions; the dark-mode population is parents reviewing the dashboard at night. Low pedagogical priority.

## 4. TECHNICAL DEBT

### D1 — TracingViewModel God-object decomposition *(D1a shipped; D1b + D1c remain)*
**Effort:** M–L for the remaining two slices · **Priority:** P1

`TracingViewModel.swift` is **2350+ lines** with ~16 responsibilities. The first slice (D1a — `RecognitionTokenTracker`) shipped on `main` (commit `7800e8e`); it pulled the UUID-equality token machinery out into a small `@MainActor` reference type so the three async recognizer call sites stop hand-rolling the same guards.

**Two remaining slices** (each one PR with CI green between):

**D1b — `TouchDispatcher`** — `beginTouch` / `updateTouch` / `endTouch`, velocity smoothing knobs, the playback-activation threshold logic. Inputs: haptics, playback, audio, freeWriteRecorder, phaseController (for `feedbackIntensity`). Outputs: callbacks for stroke-completion + canvas-progress updates. **~300 lines** to move. The risk is that `updateTouch` is the hottest code path; a runtime regression there wouldn't be caught by the existing test suite, which doesn't exercise the precise touch-debounce + audio-gate + stroke-completion combo.

**D1c — `PhaseTransitionCoordinator`** — `advanceLearningPhase`, `recordPhaseSessionCompletion`, `commitCompletion`, the post-transition side-effect block (overlay enqueue, speech praise, store writes, adaptation sample, HUD). Inputs: phaseController, freeWriteRecorder, all four stores, overlay queue, speech, syncCoordinator. **~200 lines**.

**The recognition-orchestration slice (originally planned as D1's second cut) is genuinely hard to autonomously extract.** The recognize-then-route flow has 3 entry points (freeWrite, freeform-letter, freeform-word) with distinct side effects: `lastRecognitionResult`, `freeform.isRecognizing`, `freeform.lastFreeformFormScore`, `recordFreeformCompletion`, the P2 self-explanation re-animation, and the W-30-corrected synthesised result for freeform mode. A clean callback-injected orchestrator works on paper but the coupling-point count makes it the wrong thing to do without per-slice in-the-loop review. D1a (the token-tracker piece) is the safe-autonomous portion of that work; the rest waits.

**Failure modes for the remaining slices.**
- **Forwarders.** Each property/method that views currently call must keep its name on the VM after the move.
- **MainActor isolation.** All collaborators must be `@MainActor`. Background work hops back to MainActor before mutating state.
- **Test fixtures.** `TestFixtures.StubProgressStore` etc. are used directly; new collaborators need stub-friendly initialisers.
- **Per-VM identity.** Each collaborator must be created once per VM (not shared static).

**Recommendation.** Schedule a dedicated session for D1b first (smaller risk than the recognition-orchestration cut, but still touches the hottest code path). D1c can follow once D1b is green for ~24 hours.

### D8 — Canvas redraw frequency profile
**Effort:** S (profile only) — could expand to M if a real bottleneck surfaces · **Priority:** P3

**Why deferred.** No measured evidence of a problem. On an M-class iPad it's probably fine; on an older iPad (A12 / iPad 8th gen) high-velocity drawing might drop frames because the freeWriteRecorder appends per touch event, the VM publishes the change, the canvas re-renders, the canvas re-builds the path, the GPU rasterises.

**What to do.**
1. Open Instruments → Time Profiler → run a guided session for ~30 seconds at high velocity.
2. Check the SwiftUI Update Profiler for `tracingCanvas` body invocations / second.
3. If sustained >60 invocations / sec, two cuts available:
   - Wrap static layers in `Equatable` subviews (glyph image, ghost lines, start dots only change when `currentLetterName` / `schriftArt` / `showGhost` / `phaseController.showCheckpoints` change). `.equatable()` lets SwiftUI skip body re-eval when those don't change.
   - Throttle recorder writes to ~30 Hz (every other touch event). Coalescing halves redraw count without the child noticing.

**Recommendation.** Don't pre-optimise. Profile only after a real classroom user reports lag or the device-test job reports a frame drop.

## 5. POST-THESIS

These are worthwhile additions once the thesis ships. None of them is a thesis-blocker.

### F1 — App Store readiness pass
**Effort:** L · **Priority:** P1 (post-thesis)

Privacy Manifest (`PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`) declaring `UserDefaults`, `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore`, `Application Support` writes, on-device CoreML usage. App icon set at every required size. iPad screenshots (5–7 stills covering Schule / Werkstatt / Fortschritte / Eltern-Dashboard). Marketing copy in German + English. App Store Connect "Privacy Practices" section: "Daten werden auf dem Gerät gespeichert; keine Übertragung." TestFlight build with crash-reporting opt-in.

### F2 — Lowercase letters + diacritics complete
**Effort:** XL (subsumes T1's full-alphabet scope) · **Priority:** P1 (post-thesis if T1 ships demo set only)

26 lowercase + Ä Ö Ü ß as full citizens. ~30 letters × 2–3 hours each = 60–90 person-hours.

### F3 — CloudKit sync
**Effort:** L · **Priority:** P1 (post-thesis)

`SyncCoordinator` is wired to `NullSyncService`. Implement a real CloudKit-backed `CloudSyncService` so a child using the app on multiple iPads sees a unified streak and progress. Privacy: zone-per-participant, no PII, opt-in at first launch. Depends on F1.

### F4 — Teacher dashboard (multi-child)
**Effort:** L · **Priority:** P2

Per-classroom view that shows N children's progress side-by-side. Auth via "School Code" (a 6-letter shared secret per teacher). Read-only initially; later add per-child homework assignment. Depends on F3.

### F5 — Numbers + basic punctuation
**Effort:** M · **Priority:** P2

Add `0–9` and the period/comma/question-mark glyphs. Infrastructure is letter-agnostic; ~12 new bundled glyphs.

### F6 — Additional cursive scripts
**Effort:** L · **Priority:** P2

The `SchriftArt` enum has five cases; only Druckschrift (Primae) and Schreibschrift (Playwrite AT) are bundled. Add Grundschrift, Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift, and Schulausgangsschrift once a license-compatible font ships. The code path is already in place — just unblock with font licensing.

### F7 — Apple Watch streak companion
**Effort:** M · **Priority:** P3

A single complication that shows the current streak. Tapping opens the Schule world. WatchKit extension + WCSession to read `streak.json` from the App Group. Depends on F1.

### F8 — Mac Catalyst
**Effort:** M · **Priority:** P3

`Package.swift` already targets `macOS 15.0`. Polish keyboard mappings (arrow keys for letter nav, Return to advance) and ship a Catalyst build. Depends on F1.

### F9 — Localization beyond German
**Effort:** M · **Priority:** P3

Architecture is German-only by design (curriculum-specific). For German-speaking children abroad, English UI labels with German letter content might help bilingual classrooms. Wrap UI strings in `Localizable.strings`; ship `de` (canonical) and `en` (UI only — letter content stays German).

### F10 — Switch Control + AssistiveTouch overlay
**Effort:** S–M · **Priority:** P3

For motor-impaired children, expose the direct-phase dot tap as a Switch Control target and render a parallel "Switch Control hint" overlay that highlights the next-expected dot in high contrast.

## Recommended ordering for the next sprint

The at-a-glance table at the top of this file is the authoritative version. Repeated here as a flow:

1. **T1 demo lowercase set** — block out an iPad session: open the calibration overlay (long-press phase indicator → long-press again), author stroke checkpoints for `a f i k l m o`, export to `Resources/Letters/<x>/strokes.json`. ElevenLabs the matching audio in parallel.
2. **P6 phoneme recordings** — runs in parallel with T1 since it's pure ElevenLabs work + drop-into-bundle.
3. **U5 + U10 device validation** — same iPad session: 30 minutes for the Pencil 2 squeeze check, 2–3 hours for the VoiceOver walkthrough. Get these out of the way before a thesis reviewer ever opens the app.
4. **D1b TouchDispatcher** — schedule a focused engineering session with me; one PR, ~300 lines extracted, you review the diff before D1c starts.
5. **D1c PhaseTransitionCoordinator** — after D1b has been on `main` for ~24 hours with no regression reports.

**U11 dark-mode parity** and **D8 canvas redraw profile** are post-thesis polish — schedule once the demo set ships and there's classroom-data evidence of a need (or an Instruments hint of a problem). **F1–F10** are post-thesis full features.
