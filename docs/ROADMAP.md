# Roadmap — Primae

See `docs/BAKE_INVARIANTS.md` for permanent bake invariants — apply to every letter, every weight, every bake.

_Single forward-looking work log. Last updated 2026-08-19 against `main` (commit `cb7291d`), after a full read-only reconciliation against code and git history. Only items still requiring work appear here — every shipped item has been removed. Shipped items live in commit history._

_**Correction (2026-09-03), itself now superseded (2026-09-14):** the 2026-09-03 pass reverted H5 to outstanding after measuring no phoneme files on disk. That measurement was correct **at the time**; it no longer describes the current state — the 5 pilot study-letter recordings landed `92d399e` (2026-09-14) and H5 is closed (see §2 below). Left here so the correction history isn't silently erased, not as current fact._

## At a glance — what's next

### Your ball (asset work + device validation)

| Item | Owner action | Why it matters | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **U5** Pencil 2 squeeze validation | iPad with Apple Pencil 2 — confirm squeeze + double-tap fire `replayAudio()` and don't double-fire with finger taps | Code is shipped; just needs verifying the gesture lands as intended on real hardware | **0–1 days on device** |
| **U10** VoiceOver walkthrough | iPad with VoiceOver enabled — walk every screen, watch for skipped elements / misordered focus / Switch Control routing / Dynamic Type clipping | Required before submitting the thesis externally; the partial in-code audit shipped, but the device walkthrough is the load-bearing part | **2–3 hours on device** |

### Engineering ball (in-loop sessions with me)

| Item | What I need from you | Why it can't be autonomous |
|---|---|---|
| **D8** canvas redraw profile | iPad + Instruments time-profile of a high-velocity guided session | No measured evidence of a problem; pre-optimising could break a currently-correct redraw path |

Everything in the **post-thesis** section (F1–F13) waits until the thesis ships.

**P7** (thesis KUG compliance/formatting pass) — CORRECTED same day: mostly already done (see §1 below), not blocked on anything.

**P6** (phoneme audio recordings) dropped from this table 2026-09-14: the pilot only ever needed the 5 study letters (A, F, I, L, M), and those shipped as H5 (§2 below, `92d399e`) — nothing here still blocks the study. The remaining ~25 letters × 3 takes are casual-app scope, and the casual app is out of scope for as long as it stays paused (CLAUDE.md, "The casual path is paused"); re-filed as F13, §5 POST-THESIS.

## What's already shipped this session (for context — not action)

This list is intentionally collapsed; the detail lives in commit messages. Removing the duplication that previously lived in `docs/ROADMAP_V5_DEFERRED_NOTES.md`.

- **Thesis data correctness:** condition-tagged samples, timezone header, wallClockSeconds, raw recognition confidence, researcher arm override, input-mode on durations, EXPORT_SCHEMA appendix.
- **Pedagogical features:** self-explanation re-animation on misrecognition, errorless first-3-sessions ramp, daily goal pill, spaced-retrieval testing prompts (P1 — `RetrievalScheduler`, `RetrievalPromptView`, opt-in toggle, motorSimilarity-cluster distractors, `retrievalAccuracy` CSV column), backward-chaining direct-phase toggle (P5), onboarding A/B variants with first-completion lock (U4), phoneme audio infrastructure (P6 — toggle + filename convention + scanner partition).
- **UX:** reward-celebration overlay, Schreibmotorik dimension sparklines, gold-tint token unification, celebration haptic, speech-rate slider, Bob-the-dog start-cue dwell, **full Primae rebrand** (repo + Xcode project + bundle ID + every screen restyled), **dark-mode parity (U11) via Asset-Catalog colorsets** (38 tokens; light + dark variants per colorset; flips via the parent-area Erscheinungsbild picker — System / Hell / Dunkel).
- **Tech debt:** `PaperTransferView` deterministic timing seam, CoreML classifier-closure protocol seam (D3) with 7 pipeline tests, **VM God-object decomposition (D1) fully shipped**: `RecognitionTokenTracker` (D1a, recognition tokens off the VM), `TouchDispatcher` (D1b, touch-session state + `beginTouch`/`updateTouch`/`endTouch` flow + 5 helpers + `mapVelocityToSpeed`), `PhaseTransitionCoordinator` (D1c, `advanceLearningPhase` + post-phase pipeline + `commitCompletion`). VM down from 2350+ to ~2030 lines; CI timeout caps; accessibility partial (Schreibqualität rows collapse to single VoiceOver elements). Dormant infrastructure (`SchemaMigrator` framework, `Spacing.swift` token mirror, `App/PrimaeNativeApp.swift` library-side App stub) was later removed; reintroduce from git history when the consuming feature actually arrives.
- **Stroke geometry workstream:** bake pipeline rewritten with composable arm/joint primitives (5 arm strategies + 7 joint strategies; see `docs/APP_DOCUMENTATION.md` §13). skimage-skeletonize baked into `strokes.json`; Swift loader prefers baked. Line-kind letters with arm/joint primitives ship for A, E, F, H, I, L, T, X, Z + l, v, w, x, z, plus the original M N V W b seeds. v / w apex placement via `joint_fillet_at_intersection` (trim_back=24 / 40). **Phase 2b Track B drift-from-reference gate set** enforced via `bake-gates.yml`: G1 asymmetry-profile (Pearson ≥ 0.2005), G3 perpendicular-deviation-on-straight (≤ 2.05 px), G4 junction-tangent-kink (≤ 4.43°). G2 turn-angle Pearson investigated 2026-05-23, not viable as freeze-gate metric. G5 (2026-05-24) wires the gates into CI. Open follow-up for the bake pipeline (Light + future fonts only; Regular ships as hand-calibrated artifact since `6a85811c`): Q-class topology (Q a_l ä_l g_l q_l ü_l) and ß resolver work.

## 1. THESIS-CRITICAL

### P6 — Phoneme audio recordings — CLOSED for the pilot, 2026-09-14 (H5, `92d399e`)

The pilot's 5-letter study set (A, F, I, L, M — locked, `docs/SOUND_PRODUCTION_SPEC.md:6`) each has a `<base>_phoneme1.wav`, landed and gated permanently in CI — full detail at H5, §2 below. That was the only part of the original P6 ask that could block the study, and nothing here does anymore. The full-alphabet remainder (takes 2/3 for these 5 letters, all three takes for the other 25) is casual-app scope and moved to **F13, §5 POST-THESIS** — re-scoped there, not dropped, since the casual path is paused rather than deleted.

---

### P7 — Thesis KUG compliance / formatting pass *(mostly already done; two small placeholders remain)*
**Effort:** S · **Priority:** P3

**CORRECTED 2026-09-06 (same day as first written).** The entry as originally
written here said this waits on Ch.1/6/7 being drafted, on the strength of
`docs/REVIEW_2026-09-01.md`'s (`master-thesis`) §F.4 finding that those
chapters were template placeholders. That was wrong: re-read directly against
disk, `content/01-introduction.typ` (17 lines), `06-evaluation.typ` (68
lines) and `07-conclusion.typ` (19 lines) are substantive drafted prose, and
`thesis.typ`'s English abstract, Kurzfassung, acronym-list note and keywords
are likewise real, not template text — all drafted **the same day** as the
review that flagged them (`docs/THESIS_STATUS.md` §0 and
`docs/THESIS_FRAMING.md` §3 both say "Drafted 2026-09-01"; the review's own
top banner says "corrections applied the same day," which the first pass at
this entry missed). The mistake was citing §F.4's diagnostic list (the
pre-correction state) as current fact without checking that banner.

**What's actually still open, re-verified against disk 2026-09-06:**
1. `thesis.typ:14` — `#let thesis-title = [Primae]`, still a literal
   placeholder. `THESIS_FRAMING.md:220-227` (thesis repo) names a working
   title and says explicitly "to replace." Trivial edit, but not before a
   title is chosen — thesis writing, not formatting.
2. `thesis.typ:28` — `#let thesis-date = [Month Year]`, still literal.
   Fill in at submission time; there's nothing to decide, just nothing to
   fill in yet.
3. Spelling/wording consistency (§F.3 of the review — British vs. American
   mixed, one proper-noun inconsistency, Ch.5 jargon headings):
   `docs/THESIS_STATUS.md` reports British spelling normalised, but this was
   NOT independently re-verified repo-wide this session — treat as
   reported-fixed, not confirmed-fixed, until someone greps for it.

**Verified fixed, no longer open (checked directly, not taken from the
review):** cross-references (§F.1 — `thesis.typ:90` has the
`heading.where(level:1)` supplement fix; `02-background.typ` uses
`@ch-evaluation`/`@ch-methodology` labels, not hardcoded numbers);
bibliography rendering (§F.2 — per `THESIS_STATUS.md` §0); List of
Figures/Listings (§F.4 — no longer necessarily empty: `content/03-
architecture.typ`, `04-implementation.typ`, `05-methodology.typ` now contain
5 `#figure(...)` calls between them); keywords (`thesis.typ:35` now reads
"letter learning, sonification, phoneme, handwriting, iPad, pilot study,
Druckschrift" — describes the thesis, not the old iOS-generic list).
`typst compile thesis.typ` exits 0, 75 pages, only the two known font
warnings (re-run 2026-09-06).

Nothing here is Primae's to action — it's thesis-repo prose/formatting, and
what remains (title choice, date, one unverified spelling pass) is a final
proofread pass near submission, not blocked engineering work.

## 2. PILOT STUDY — freeze items & known issues

_Consolidated from the former `PILOT_READINESS.md` (2026-06-20). The decision rationale for everything here lives in `docs/DECISIONS.md`; this section holds the **work** (freeze items) and the **open issues/residuals**._

### Freeze items — HIGH (pilot cannot run as designed without these)

| # | Item | Type | Reuse / notes |
|---|------|------|---------------|
| H1 | `PilotAudioCondition: { phoneme, spatial, silent }` enum + assignment. _(2026-07-06: the third arm was redesigned from `arbitrarySound` to `spatial` — spatial 2D sonification, pen Y→pitch / X→pan on a shared carrier tone; the assignment machinery is unchanged.)_ Pedagogical flow held constant (D1), so this is the audio dimension only. **SHIPPED (`279d553`, 2026-06-20)** — orthogonal to `ThesisCondition` (UUID byte 15, decorrelated from byte 0), with override, enrollment, and exporter stamping; `PilotAudioConditionAssignmentTests`. | Build | Slotted into existing UUID-modulo assignment + override + enrollment + per-arm exporter, as planned. |
| H2 | Arm-aware audio selection — `activeAudioFiles(for:)` branches on the pilot arm. **SHIPPED (`b212e82`, 2026-06-20; arm redesigned 2026-07-06)** — `.silent → []`, `.spatial → [SpatialSonification.carrierToneFile]` (one shared, letter-independent carrier; deliberately no name-audio fallback), `.phoneme → phoneme/name per toggle` (H2.1 tightened this; see known issues); `AudioArmRoutingTests`. | Build | Single chokepoint as planned. Both sound arms share the `setAdaptivePlayback` rate+pan coupling; the spatial arm ADDITIONALLY drives pitch from pen Y (`setSpatialPitch`, per-tick, spatial-only) — the arms are matched on rate+pan and differ in pitch-drive + sound identity (reframed matching discipline; DECISIONS.md study-design header and D2 row brought current 2026-09-04). |
| H3 | Silent-arm codepath. **SHIPPED (with H2, `b212e82`)** — `.silent` returns `[]` and every read site short-circuits on an empty list, so no file loads and no coupling fires. `AudioEngine.swift` untouched (stable/fragile). | Build | Delivered via the H2 chokepoint, as planned. |
| H4 | ~~Arbitrary-sound asset set~~ **SUPERSEDED (2026-07-06):** the third arm is now spatial 2D sonification; its only asset — the seamless 440 Hz triangle carrier `Resources/Sonification/spatial_carrier.wav` — is bundled. No per-letter abstract sounds are needed; the Groß-Vogt abstract-sound design ask is off the critical path. (DECISIONS.md D2-supersession entry brought current 2026-09-04.) | — | `SOUND_PRODUCTION_SPEC.md` carries a 2026-09-04 status banner (ruling C3-5) scoping §5/abstract-sounds to the full-scale study's fourth arm, not the pilot — no longer stale against code. |
| H5 | P6 phoneme recordings — **SHIPPED (`92d399e`, 2026-09-14).** All five files landed as WAV — `<base>_phoneme1.wav` under `Resources/Letters/{A,F,I,L,M}/` — with zero code changes (`findAudioAssets`'s supported-extension set already included `wav`; `partitionPhonemeAudio`'s `_phoneme` substring match has no extension check). Verified at runtime, not just read: CI on the real bundle (`BundleLetterResourceProvider`) flipped `studyLetterPhonemesResolve` from a `withKnownIssue` to a real pass; the wrapper is removed (`ResourceResolutionTests.swift`), turning the H5 check into a permanent gate. | Assets | Closed. |
| H6 | Post-test reachability for the two untrained study letters — the within-child trained-vs-untrained contrast the design depends on. Re-scoped 2026-09-03 to what the pilot's stated outcome (Fréchet deviation + time) actually needs: the production measure `freeWrite` already scores. The original 3-modality (recognition/production/letter-sound) battery was NOT built — out of scope for the pilot; `PostTestController`/distractor-picker/researcher-start-screen never existed and don't need to now. **SHIPPED (`598fcbf`, 2026-09-03)** — `TracingViewModel.startPostTest(letter:)` loads either untrained letter and jumps the phase controller straight to `freeWrite` (observe/guided skipped entirely — reaching either would BE training the letter), via a one-shot override consumed in `load(letter:)`. No new export tagging needed: `trainedSubset` was already stamped on every row. `ResearchDashboardView` gets a studyMode-only trigger. `StudyLetterSetTests` covers reachability, refusal of a trained letter, refusal outside studyMode, and that the override doesn't leak into the next normal load. | Build | Reused `loadLetter` (never gated by `visibleLetterNames` — only the UI pickers were) and the existing `LearningPhaseController.resume(at:)`, as planned. |

> H5 is the pilot-arm dependency of the same recordings §1 P6 (now closed) and F13 (§5) describe — this row is the one that actually gated the study; F13 is the leftover full-alphabet work, post-thesis.

### Known issues / residuals

_Pilot-blocking and tracked-not-built issues consolidated from PILOT_READINESS (2026-06-20)._

**Known issue — CalibrationStore override-shadow (pilot-blocking).**
- This shadow is now a thesis-truth-condition: Ch.5's reframe asserts every child traces the identical frozen stimulus, which is false on a device where CalibrationStore overrides outrank the bundle for Druckschrift. Fix (study-mode guard + cleared overrides) is required before the pilot, not optional hardening.
- **RESOLVED — `studyMode` mechanism complete and operable (CI-green):** the `studyMode` flag (off by default, persisted) + the `resolvedStrokes(for:)` guard + the researcher toggle + the (font-scoped) clear-overrides control are all built, reachable in ResearchDashboardView, and CI-green (commits `84b759e`, `fd2b789`). The thesis-truth-condition now has a working, reachable mechanism.
  - **Precise guard invariant (cite THIS, not the broader version):** the calibration override is read in exactly **two** places — the guarded resolve `resolvedStrokes(for:)` (`TracingViewModel.swift:250`) and the export path `loadAllEffectiveStrokes` (`:1729`). `studyMode` ON forces bundle geometry at the guarded resolve. NOTE: multi-cell **word mode** loads non-active cells' bundle strokes directly (`:1667`) WITHOUT going through `resolvedStrokes` — this is safe (that path never reads an override), but it means the precisely-true invariant is "**the override is read in 2 sites**," NOT "all scored geometry routes through one chokepoint." Ch.5's identical-frozen-stimulus truth-condition rests on this, so cite the 2-read-sites invariant.
  - **clear-overrides scope is FONT-SCOPED, not global:** the clear-overrides control — and the new-participant reset's calibration wipe, which calls the same `clearAllCalibrations()` — resolves to `clearAll(for: vm.schriftArt)`, deleting only the **active** font's calibration directory; other `SchriftArt` calibration dirs survive. Harmless for the Druckschrift-only pilot (the active font IS the pilot font), but the wipe is **not global**.
  - **Test coverage:** bundle target pinned by `StrokeGeometryGoldenTests`; additionally `StudyModeGuardTests.swift` exercises the guard against a **real persisted override** (ON → bundle, OFF → override) — stronger proof than the golden test alone.
  - Remaining deferred: the post-guard on-device golden layer pinning the font-derived bbox→cell mapping (waits on the new font).

**Known issue — phoneme arm depends on `enablePhonemeMode` (pilot-blocking, H2.1).**
- H2 routes `activeAudioFiles(for:)` on the audio arm, but the `.phoneme` branch deliberately preserves the legacy parent toggle: `enablePhonemeMode ? phonemes : name audio`. This keeps casual/non-enrolled users byte-identical. **The cost:** a phoneme-arm study device with `enablePhonemeMode` OFF plays the letter **name** audio (`/aː/`) instead of the **phoneme** (`/a/`) — a silent confound that corrupts the IV with **no error surfaced**. The `.silent` and `.spatial` arms are unaffected (they ignore the toggle).
- **RESOLVED — H2.1 shipped (`724d664`, 2026-06-20):** when `studyMode` is on, the `.phoneme` arm forces `phonemeAudioFiles` regardless of the toggle, resolved at **letter-load** in `activeAudioFiles(for:)` (`TracingViewModel.swift:843`), never on the per-tick `updateAdaptivePlayback` path — the matching-discipline coupling stays file-list-agnostic. `studyMode` OFF preserves the exact pre-pilot toggle behaviour (casual users byte-identical). Tests cover both toggle states under `studyMode`.
- **Residual CLOSED (2026-09-14, H5 shipped):** the degrade-to-name-audio fallback this residual described is now dormant for the pilot's five study letters — all five have a phoneme recording, verified above. `pilotAudioLogger.warning` and the ResearchDashboard phoneme-coverage census remain in place as a general-case guard (any future letter without a recording still degrades and surfaces), but no study letter is in that state.

**Known issue — new-participant reset→relaunch window (low-risk, tracked not built).**
- The "Neuer Teilnehmer" reset (ResearchDashboard) regenerates participant identity (new UUID → re-randomised arms) but the running VM holds `thesisCondition`/`audioCondition` as `let` captured at init, so the new arms only take effect on app relaunch — enforced by a "Neustart erforderlich" alert.
- **Residual:** if a proctor ignores that alert, exits the parent area, and lets a child trace BEFORE relaunching, that record carries the **new participantId** but the **old arm** — a **mislabeled (not dropped)** record. (`recordedAt > enrolledAt`, so it survives the exporter's pre-enrolment filter.) The opposite failure — a real record silently dropped for `recordedAt < enrolledAt` — is impossible: `enrolledAt` is stamped at reset and all post-relaunch records are strictly later.
- **Mitigated by protocol:** after reset the device sits in the parent-gated research tab (no tracing surface) and the relaunch alert directs an immediate restart, so the window requires the proctor to actively ignore it.
- **Optional hardening (not built):** gate `recordPhaseSession` until relaunch after a reset (e.g. a "reset pending" flag that suppresses recording until the arms are re-seeded). Low-risk for a proctored single-session pilot; tracked here, not built.

**Investigated — Fréchet primary measure is cross-lift-safe (no fix needed, 2026-06).**
- The cross-pen-lift concatenation in the Fréchet primary measure (`FreeWriteScorer.score` → `formAccuracy` → `referencePolyline`) was investigated and found **Fréchet-SAFE**. `referencePolyline` concatenates all strokes into one polyline and resamples by arc length, bridging each lift gap with a phantom diagonal — but discrete Fréchet couples the trace's gap-bridge to the reference's gap-bridge at matching arc-length fractions, so the phantom diagonal **cannot inflate the score beyond the real per-stroke error** (empirically **≤1.4% on real letters, 0 in most cases, always toward HIGHER scores** — removing inflation can only reduce distance).
- The genuine cross-lift "tank" the older docstring describes was on the **Hausdorff `formAccuracyShape`** (freeform / Werkstatt path), which is **already per-stroke-densified**. It is NOT the recorded thesis measure.
- **No fix to the primary measure is warranted.** Threading `strokeStartIndices` through the outcome variable to shift it ≤1.4% would add risk for no benefit; the guarded-geometry "strong reason" is absent.
- **Replica validation** (faithful Double-precision reimplementation of referencePolyline + arc-length resample + discrete-Fréchet DP + `radius*3` scaling): real **A / T / H** (multi-stroke) and **I** (single-stroke) bundle letters, plus synthetic **long-gap**, **length-mismatch**, and **gross-displacement** regimes. Single-stroke moved exactly 0; multi-stroke moved ≤+0.017, always up.

## 3. UX — DEFERRED

### U5 — Apple Pencil 2 squeeze *(wired on main; needs device validation)*
**Effort:** S (already done in code) — but **0–1 days for device validation** · **Priority:** P3

**Status.** Wired into `PencilAwareCanvasOverlay`. `UIPencilInteraction` is installed lazily; squeeze and double-tap both trigger `vm.replayAudio()`. Devices without `UIPencilInteraction` support pass nil and the interaction is never installed.

**What's needed before merging to main.** Real iPad with Apple Pencil 2nd gen, in your hand. Check:
- Squeeze fires the audio replay (not a "switch tools" default action).
- Double-tap (the legacy gesture) also fires the audio replay.
- Finger-only sessions never invoke the handler.
- Audio doesn't double-fire when squeeze + finger-tap occur in rapid succession.

If any of those fails on device, the fix is a tweak in `Coordinator.pencilInteractionDidTap`.

---

### U10 — Accessibility audit *(partial shipped; full audit needs device)*
**Effort:** S–M · **Priority:** P3

**What's already done (on `main`).**
- Schreibqualität dimension rows collapse to one VoiceOver element per row ("Form, 78 Prozent") instead of three separate focuses.
- Reward badges, daily-goal pill, settings additions, celebration overlay all carry combined-element labels + hints.
- Sparkline view is `accessibilityHidden(true)`.

**What's still needed (real iPad with VoiceOver enabled).**
- Walk every screen in VoiceOver order. Watch for skipped elements, misordered focus, ambiguous labels.
- Verify the order of focus in `SchuleWorldView` after a phase advance — does the "Weiter" button get focus before the celebration is announced, or vice versa?
- Switch Control routing — direct-phase dot taps need to be reachable via the switch.
- AssistiveTouch overlay — confirm the touch-handler hierarchy doesn't block AssistiveTouch's hit-testing.
- Dynamic Type stress test — the dashboard rows should not clip at the largest accessibility text size.

**Recommendation.** Schedule 2–3 hours with VoiceOver enabled on the iPad before submitting the thesis to anyone external.

## 4. TECHNICAL DEBT

### D11 — Measurement-layer correctness residuals
**Effort:** S each · **Priority:** P1 for the two data-integrity items — both now CLOSED (#1, #2)

Found by the 2026-08-19 reconciliation; none of these was previously tracked.

1. ~~**Pre-enrolment filter guards only the raw rows.**~~ **CLOSED (`881116b`, 2026-09-03,
   found already merged to `main` — this entry was just never marked).** `ParentDashboardExporter
   .swift` now filters ONCE into `enrolledRecords` and every aggregate (`averageFreeWriteScore_<arm>`,
   `schedulerEffectivenessProxy_<arm>`, `letterByArm`, `letterByAudioArm`) reads that, never
   `snapshot.phaseSessionRecords` directly — see the `D11#1` comment at the filter site.
2. ~~**Scheduler proxy assumes array order is chronological.**~~ **CLOSED (this pass, 2026-09-04).**
   Both `ParentDashboardStore.schedulerEffectivenessProxy` and `ParentDashboardExporter`'s per-arm
   proxy now `.sorted { ($0.recordedAt ?? .distantPast) < ($1.recordedAt ?? .distantPast) }` before
   pairing consecutive records — see the `D11#2` comments at both sites.
3. **Export failure policy is implemented but undecided.** All three call sites are fail-loud
   and the destructive new-participant path is correctly gated behind a successful export.
   Missing is the DECISIONS entry recording that as policy — see DEFER 23. Doc-only.
4. **Golden-file export test.** `ExporterArmStratificationTests` gives structural coverage and
   its header calls it "Golden coverage", but no checked-in CSV fixture exists. A byte-comparison
   golden over a fixed snapshot is still absent. See DEFER 22.
5. ~~**CoreML model is compiled at runtime.**~~ **CLOSED (`1d9ff92`, 2026-08-19).** The model
   moved to its own resource root (`PrimaeNative/MLResources/`) carrying `.process`, scoped
   away from the 87 identically-named `strokes.json` files under `Resources/`. Loader and test
   (`modelShipsCompiled`) both walk the same probe list; runtime `compileModel(at:)` retained
   as a fallback for a raw `.mlpackage`, no longer the expected route.

### D12 — Execute the D5 `direct`-phase cut
**Effort:** M · **Priority:** P2

`docs/DECISIONS.md` locks D5 (cut `direct`, move to three-phase `observe → guided → freeWrite`)
on a six-paper evidence read, but the cut was never executed and appeared in no work log:
`LearningPhase.swift:17` still declares `case direct = 1` and the exporter deliberately iterates
it. Blast radius and the Codable `rawValue` backward-compat constraint are recorded in DECISIONS.
Not pilot-blocking (flow is held constant across arms either way).

---

### D8 — Canvas redraw frequency profile
**Effort:** S (profile only) — could expand to M if a real bottleneck surfaces · **Priority:** P3

**Why deferred.** No measured evidence of a problem. On an M-class iPad it's probably fine; on an older iPad (A12 / iPad 8th gen) high-velocity drawing might drop frames because the freeWriteRecorder appends per touch event, the VM publishes the change, the canvas re-renders, the canvas re-builds the path, the GPU rasterises.

**What to do.**
1. Open Instruments → Time Profiler → run a guided session for ~30 seconds at high velocity.
2. Check the SwiftUI Update Profiler for `tracingCanvas` body invocations / second.
3. If sustained >60 invocations / sec, two cuts available:
   - Wrap static layers in `Equatable` subviews (glyph image, ghost lines, start dots only change when `currentLetterName` / `schriftArt` / `showGhost` / `phaseController.showCheckpoints` change). `.equatable()` lets SwiftUI skip body re-eval when those don't change.
   - Throttle recorder writes to ~30 Hz (every other touch event). Coalescing halves redraw count without the child noticing.

**Recommendation.** Don't pre-optimise. Profile only after a real classroom user reports lag or the device-test job reports a frame drop.

---

### D9 — Renderer architecture open questions
**Effort:** M (design + impl) · **Priority:** P3

Carried forward from the now-removed `docs/RENDERING.md` "Open questions for renderer implementation" section (migrated here 2026-05-25; RENDERING.md itself deleted 2026-06-20, its rendering model consolidated into `docs/BAKE_INVARIANTS.md` §5). Four polish-tier renderer-architecture questions, none answered in code today:

1. **Default display band width + finger/pencil scaling logic.** `TracingCanvasView` uses hardcoded `lineWidth` values per layer (6 / 8 / 12 / 14) and modulates pencil ink via `8 + pressure * 14`; there's no finger/pencil mode switch for the display band itself, and no scaling logic relating display-band width to letter render size. Decide: smooth crossfade vs hard switch on input-device detection.
2. **Mid-stroke device change support.** Touch type is read at touch-down and not re-evaluated mid-stroke. Decide whether to detect (and how to handle: re-style mid-stroke, ignore, snap to one or the other).
3. **Pencil scoring tolerance band tuning.** `StrokeTracker` uses `checkpointRadius * radiusMultiplier` for difficulty adaptation; there's no pencil-vs-finger tolerance split. The now-removed RENDERING.md (model now in `docs/BAKE_INVARIANTS.md` §5) suggested starting at 50% of the display band's half-width — needs derivation against real device data.
4. **Glyph fade-out vs persistent visibility during tracing.** Typical learn-to-write apps fade the display glyph as the child traces over it; Primae currently keeps it persistent. Decide based on classroom observation / pedagogy literature.

**Why deferred.** Polish-tier UX questions; current rendering is functional. None of these blocks the thesis.

**Trigger to revisit.** Post-thesis F1 (App Store readiness) is a natural moment to revisit display-band tuning. The other three can wait for classroom-data evidence.

### D10 — Self-hosted CI runner toolchain drift — CLOSED 2026-07-13 (obsolete, not fixed)

The job this item tracked no longer exists. `c673176` (2026-07-13) retired the self-hosted
MacBook jobs — "hosted macos-26 simulator matrix only" — eleven days after the 2026-07-02
re-break this section described. `grep -rn "self-hosted" .github/` returns nothing; the
workflow now runs `stroke_audit`, `xcode_test`, `study_build`. Kept as a stub because two
other docs still reference the removed `ipad-device-test.yml`
(`docs/APP_DOCUMENTATION.md:223`, `:1826`) and `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md:31` still lists the
self-hosted runner as live.

**Consequence that outlives the item.** The on-device golden layer left open under the
CalibrationStore known-issue in §2 named this runner as its precondition. There is now no
device CI at all, so that work is not merely blocked — it needs re-scoping as a manual
on-device act (like the pilot artefact build in CLAUDE.md) or dropping.

## 5. POST-THESIS

These are worthwhile additions once the thesis ships. None of them is a thesis-blocker.

**Prerequisite for all of F1–F12, recorded 2026-09-13, UPDATED 2026-09-14:** the
casual `Debug`/`Release` path is paused, not deleted (`CLAUDE.md`, "The casual
path is paused") — CI no longer builds, tests, or compares it against study.
As of 2026-09-14 this went one step further: `STUDY_BUILD` is unconditional in
`Package.swift` (`CLAUDE.md`, "STUDY_BUILD made unconditional"), so the casual
configuration cannot even LINK anymore, not just "isn't exercised." Every item
below assumes a working casual build; restoring active casual CI is the first
act of resuming any of them, not a side effect of picking one up. Concrete
pieces of that restoration, already scoped so nobody re-derives them from
scratch:
1. Remove (or make conditional) the `.define("STUDY_BUILD")` swiftSettings
   entries in `Package.swift` (`PrimaeNative` and `PrimaeNativeTests` targets)
   — this is the actual gate now; without this step nothing else here matters.
2. Re-add a CI job/step that builds `Debug`/`Release` again (removed:
   "CONTROL B", "Build the normal build for comparison"; the identity-scan
   step's normal-side checks were rewritten to study-only, not just skipped —
   restoring the comparison means writing that half back, not un-skipping it).
   `CONTROL A` ("Debug-Study without the flag must FAIL to link") is also gone
   and would need re-adding IF the flag goes back to being conditional rather
   than unconditional — re-derive it from `CLAUDE.md`'s description of what it
   asserted, don't assume the old removed step can just be pasted back
   unchanged, since the mechanism it was guarding no longer exists in the
   same shape.
3. Flip the main `xcode_test` job's `-scheme Primae-Study -configuration
   Debug-Study` back to `-scheme Primae -configuration Debug` (or whichever
   configuration makes sense at that point). The 2026-09-13 caution here — "12
   of 72 test files construct non-study scenarios... may not even compile" —
   was checked directly on 2026-09-14 and did NOT hold up: a full sweep found
   zero test-file references to any symbol `STUDY_BUILD` compiles out of the
   package, and no test constructs an unpinned `TracingDependencies()` that
   would inherit the compile-time default. That specific worry can be
   retired; re-verify quickly rather than re-deriving from scratch, since
   whatever code exists by the restoration date may have drifted from what
   was measured here.

### F1 — App Store readiness pass
**Effort:** L · **Priority:** P1 (post-thesis)

Privacy Manifest shipped 2026-07-07 (`UserDefaults` CA92.1 + file-timestamp C617.1 for the container writes; CoreML has no required-reason category, so nothing to declare there). `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=NO` shipped the same day. Remaining: app icon set at every required size. iPad screenshots (5–7 stills covering Schule / Werkstatt / Fortschritte / Eltern-Dashboard). Marketing copy in German + English. App Store Connect "Privacy Practices" section: "Daten werden auf dem Gerät gespeichert; keine Übertragung." TestFlight build with crash-reporting opt-in.

### F2 — Lowercase letters + diacritics complete
**Effort:** XL (subsumes T1's full-alphabet scope) · **Priority:** P1 (post-thesis if T1 ships demo set only)

26 lowercase + Ä Ö Ü ß as full citizens. ~30 letters × 2–3 hours each = 60–90 person-hours.

### F3 — CloudKit sync
**Effort:** L · **Priority:** P1 (post-thesis)

A child using the app on multiple iPads should see unified streak + progress. Implement as a CloudKit-backed sync that pushes `ProgressRecord` and `StreakRecord` snapshots after each phase completion. Privacy: zone-per-participant, no PII, opt-in at first launch. Depends on F1. (Scaffolding for this — `CloudSyncService` protocol + `NullSyncService` + `SyncCoordinator` — was removed from `main` to drop dormant code; reintroduce together with the real CloudKit conformer.)

### F4 — Teacher dashboard (multi-child)
**Effort:** L · **Priority:** P2

Per-classroom view that shows N children's progress side-by-side. Auth via "School Code" (a 6-letter shared secret per teacher). Read-only initially; later add per-child homework assignment. Depends on F3.

### F5 — Numbers + basic punctuation
**Effort:** M · **Priority:** P2

Add `0–9` and the period/comma/question-mark glyphs. Infrastructure is letter-agnostic; ~12 new bundled glyphs.

### F6 — Additional cursive scripts
**Effort:** L · **Priority:** P2

The `SchriftArt` enum has five cases; only Druckschrift (Primae) and Schreibschrift (Playwrite AT) are bundled. Add Grundschrift, Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift, and Schulausgangsschrift once a license-compatible font ships. The code path is already in place — just unblock with font licensing.

### F7 — Apple Watch streak companion
**Effort:** M · **Priority:** P3

A single complication that shows the current streak. Tapping opens the Schule world. WatchKit extension + WCSession to read `streak.json` from the App Group. Depends on F1.

**Consequence of the 2026-09-07 study-build bundle-ID split (`CLAUDE.md`, "Study builds"): the App Group this item needs is scoped to the CASUAL app's bundle identifier (`com.flamingistan.primae`) only.** Study now ships under its own, separate `com.flamingistan.primae.study`, with no shared container between the two — verified, not assumed (see `CLAUDE.md`). Whoever builds this companion should create the App Group under the casual bundle ID and expect it to reach only the casual app's `streak.json`; it will not, and should not, see anything a study build wrote. That's correct, not a gap to close — a study instrument is deliberately isolated from the casual app's data.

### F8 — Mac Catalyst
**Effort:** M · **Priority:** P3

`Package.swift` already targets `macOS 15.0`. Polish keyboard mappings (arrow keys for letter nav, Return to advance) and ship a Catalyst build. Depends on F1.

### F9 — Localization beyond German
**Effort:** M · **Priority:** P3

Architecture is German-only by design (curriculum-specific). For German-speaking children abroad, English UI labels with German letter content might help bilingual classrooms. Wrap UI strings in `Localizable.strings`; ship `de` (canonical) and `en` (UI only — letter content stays German).

### F10 — Switch Control + AssistiveTouch overlay
**Effort:** S–M · **Priority:** P3

For motor-impaired children, expose the direct-phase dot tap as a Switch Control target and render a parallel "Switch Control hint" overlay that highlights the next-expected dot in high contrast.

### F11 — iOS 27 SDK move
**Effort:** S–M · **Priority:** P1 (post-pilot; hard deadline if the App Store mandates the iOS 27 SDK, projected ~April 2027 — unconfirmed as of 2026-07-07)

Per the 2026-07-07 readiness audit the app already satisfies both mandatory iOS 27 migrations (never used `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility`; pure SwiftUI App lifecycle), uses none of the reported deprecations (`UIScreen.main`, SceneKit), and no AVAudioSession / AVSpeechSynthesizer deprecations surfaced — `AudioEngine.swift` is unthreatened. The move is therefore a toolchain bump, gated on:
- **Xcode 27 stability** — early betas crash the compiler; there is a known inliner crash with exactly our configuration, `-default-isolation MainActor` + `-O` (swiftlang/swift#88173). **Verify a Release build, not just Debug CI, before adopting.**
- ~~**CI availability** — no `macos-27` hosted runner and no Xcode 27 on the `macos-26` image yet.~~ **CORRECTED 2026-08-18: this blocker was false.** A hosted image labelled **`xcode-27`** has existed since **2026-07-16**. The 2026-07-07 gate searched for a `macos-27` label, which is not how the image is named, and the negative result was recorded as an availability blocker rather than as a failed search. Nothing was blocking CI adoption from 2026-07-16 onward. Lesson worth keeping: a gate that searches for the wrong identifier returns "absent" indistinguishably from "does not exist" — the same failure shape as the identity scan reading the wrong binary (`9b01dcd`).
- **Toolchain pin** — the operator decided on 2026-08-18 that Xcode 27 applies across every Apple project in the estate, pinned by MAJOR version (not exact build), with the pin living **in each repo** and this workstation authoritative, CI following. Recorded at homelab-architecture #624, `decisions/DECISION-LOG.md`, slug `xcode-27-toolchain-decision-2026-08-18` — read it there, not from a relay. Primae's pin shape is still to be chosen; `estate-app` #32 uses a `bin/toolchain.pin` data file plus a verify leg that reads it, which is one shape and not a mandate. Until a pin lands, the device procedure in CLAUDE.md is the only thing recording which compiler built a pilot artefact.
- Optional modernization to fold in: Icon Composer layered `.icon` (current icon is the classic PNG light/dark/tinted set — still works) and a String Catalog if F9 localization happens.
- **Partial evidence toward the `-O` gate (2026-08-19, unrecorded until now):** this workstation
  measures Swift 6.4 / Xcode-beta, and PR #11 (`1df0feb`) reports a successful local
  `Release-Study` `-O` compile on Xcode 27 beta. That is one clean compile, not a cleared gate —
  swiftlang/swift#88173 is an inliner crash, so absence on one build is weak evidence.

### F12 — Xcode MCP bridge *(declined 2026-08-15; revisit post-pilot)*
**Effort:** S to adopt · **Priority:** P3 (post-pilot only)

An Xcode MCP bridge would let a session drive builds / tests / simulators directly instead of shelling out to `xcodebuild`. **Declined for now**, and the reason is structural rather than a matter of taste: this project exposes **two build surfaces** — the SPM package (`Package.swift` → `PrimaeNative`, where `PrimaeNativeTests` actually lives) and `Primae/Primae.xcodeproj` (three schemes) — and a bridge binds to one workspace at a time. A bridge pointed at the wrong surface reports green for a target nobody meant to validate, and that failure is silent: a green is a green. Not an acceptable risk while the study configuration is frozen and heading into device validation, where a false green propagates straight into the pilot.

Conditions for revisiting, after the pilot has run:
- The bridge can be pinned explicitly to a named workspace **and** scheme, and that pin is checked in — not inferred per session.
- It reports which surface it built, in its output, on every invocation.
- The `xcodebuild` invocations in this file and CLAUDE.md remain the documented fallback, so a bridge failure degrades to the known-good path.

**If adopted, it must be declared in a tracked `.mcp.json` at the repo root — never in `~/.claude.json`.** A user-level registration is invisible to the repo, unreviewable in a diff, and would not travel with a fresh clone: two sessions on the same commit could then be validating different targets with no record of the difference.

### F13 — Phoneme recordings, full alphabet *(moved from §1 P6, 2026-09-14 — pilot subset already shipped, see H5 §2)*
**Effort:** XL (recording + voice direction work) · **Priority:** P1 (post-thesis, i.e. once casual resumes — see this section's prerequisite note above)

Phonemic awareness (Adams 1990) predicts later reading acquisition; pairing handwriting practice with the *sound* the letter makes (`/a/` as in *Affe*) instead of just its name (`/aː/`) is curriculum-aligned for German Volksschule. This is why the item carries a thesis-strength P1 even though it's post-thesis-timed: it's not polish, it's the casual app's version of a feature the pilot already validates on its 5-letter subset.

**Already in code (on `main`), pilot-proven:**
- `LetterAsset.phonemeAudioFiles: [String]` — populated by `LetterRepository.partitionPhonemeAudio` from the bundle scan.
- `enablePhonemeMode: Bool` UserDefaults toggle, threaded through `TracingDependencies` and the VM.
- All 7 audio call sites routed through `activeAudioFiles(for:)`. Toggle-on with no phoneme recordings → silent fallback to letter-name set — so an incomplete recording set degrades safely rather than breaking.
- SettingsView "Lautwert" section with the toggle + Adams 1990 caption.

**What's still needed, once casual CI resumes:**
1. **Audio recordings**, convention `<base>_phoneme<n>.<ext>` per Appendix C in `docs/APP_DOCUMENTATION.md`, three takes per letter, 30 letters. Only `_phoneme1` exists so far, and only for the 5 pilot letters (`ls PrimaeNative/Resources/Letters/{A,F,I,L,M}/ | grep phoneme`, 2026-09-14) — takes 2/3 for those 5, and all three takes for the other 25, are open.
2. Per-letter IPA target table is in Appendix C; the recording procedure (no-schwa Anlaut articulation, D6 stop-consonant handling, checklist) is in `docs/SOUND_PRODUCTION_SPEC.md`. Clean-up (trim silence, normalise to -16 LUFS, export at 44.1 kHz mono) is the per-file labour.
3. **Bundle wiring.** Drop the files into `PrimaeNative/Resources/Letters/<base>/`. Repository scan picks them up automatically; no Swift code changes required — reconfirmed by the pilot subset landing with zero code changes.
4. **Verification checklist** (in the appendix): toggle on → tap → phoneme plays; two-finger swipe cycles through takes; toggle off → name resumes.

## Recommended ordering for the next sprint

The at-a-glance table at the top of this file is the authoritative version. Repeated here as a flow:

1. **U5 + U10 device validation** — single iPad session: 30 minutes for the Pencil 2 squeeze check, 2–3 hours for the VoiceOver walkthrough. Get these out of the way before a thesis reviewer ever opens the app.

P6's pilot-blocking piece shipped 2026-09-14 (H5) and is off this list; its full-alphabet remainder moved to F13, §5, post-thesis.

**D8 canvas redraw profile** is post-thesis polish — schedule once there's classroom-data evidence of a need (or an Instruments hint of a problem). **F1–F13** are post-thesis full features.
